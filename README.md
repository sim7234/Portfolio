### Overview

Goal: Make a fun 3D horror game with my class mates with the concept of Sending a SoS signal while being distracted by a monster and minigames.

My Contributions: I worked extensivly on two of the three minigames and itterated or completly reworked scripts as needed all around the project.
I also worked on interaction for the player with everything around the map.
