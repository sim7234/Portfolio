### Overview

Goal: Make a fun 3D horror game with my class mates with the concept of Sending a SoS signal while being distracted by a monster and minigames.

My Contributions: I worked extensively on two of the three minigames and iterated or completely reworked scripts as needed all around the project.
I also worked on interaction for the player with everything around the map.

### Overview

Goal: I was learning Unreal Engine and Visual scripting for the first time, i was really hooked on the idea of making a high quality movement runner game as i love the wall running and double jump mechanics in Titanfall 2 but would rather not deal with anything related to aiming while running on walls.

My Contributions: This is an entirely self made project, i made all the code, the good and the bad.
