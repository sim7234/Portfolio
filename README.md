### Overview

Goal: Make a fun 3D horror game with my class mates with the concept of Sending a SoS signal while being distracted by a monster and minigames.

My Contributions: I worked extensively on two of the three minigames and iterated or completely reworked scripts as needed all around the project.
I also worked on interaction for the player with everything around the map.

### Overview

Goal: I was learning Unreal Engine and Visual scripting for the first time, i was really hooked on the idea of making a high quality movement runner game as i love the wall running and double jump mechanics in Titanfall 2 but would rather not deal with anything related to aiming while running on walls.

My Contributions: This is an entirely self made project, i made all the code, the good and the bad.

### Overview

A 2D top down shooter with lots of perks and chaos, this is my personal side project where i experimented with a custom perk creation system that allows for easy creation of perks with lots of customizability with the help of scriptable objects.

## My style of coding

I like to make reusable systems, those based either on settings in the inspector or scriptable objects, example would be the perk system in the 2D shooter chapter.

In my code i try to make it as readable as possible as most programers do, some of the things i do to accomplish this:

* All my functions are written in the order they execute if they are called within the script.

* Usage of return within if statements to break them up and make the code blocks less cluttered.

* Usage of descriptive names of all variables.
