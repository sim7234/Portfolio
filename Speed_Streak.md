## Goal:
To make a mechanic where i can wall run like Titanfall 2 together with as smooth movement i could make.

How i started: I began by figuring out how custom movement would work in unreal, i made a simple ground slide by pushing the player forward, then a downwards slide by altering gravity and friction, a simple sprint that doubles movement speed when pressed that i show below.

It is wierdly enough harder to show unreals visual code here so i will only show two simple functions i made.

What i would do differently: Now that i have a better understanding of unreal and blueprints i would start by splitting code up in different functions and especially in *different scripts*, yup i put everything in the same blueprint because i did not wanna connect different blueprints in unreal at the same time im trying to figure out how to make the player smoothly slide down and then up a slope.

I could also potentially gone into C++ a bit to make the slope calculations, not sure if that would be better though.

In the end i am still proud of what i have made here, the game is very fun to play for me and for other people in my class.
