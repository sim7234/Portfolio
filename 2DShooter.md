# Goal

For this game my goal was simply to experiment with different concepts in programming, especially scriptable objects and class inheritance that i didn't fully understand at the start of this project. <br> But for the game itself i
just had the idea you win when you crash and i wanted you to win late with chaos everywhere.

The first major system i worked on is the games perk creation system, i wanted a way to quickly and easily create perks using scriptable object with lots of settings on how they are triggered and what the perk does once triggered.
